StructuredProperties Configuration Parser

StructuredProperties is a parser designed around the same general
style as the java Properties class, intended to provide a simple
configuration file format for Java programs.

For a definition of the syntax and for example usage, please look
at the 'example.conf' file.

To build StructuredProperties, you will need a recent JDK and the
JFlex tool from http://jflex.de/ installed in your system path as
"jflex", along with Apache Ant for building.

No documentation for the API is ready yet, however JavaDoc
documents are on the way. The basic usage is simple, however, just
create yourself a new File object to represent your configuration
file, and pass it to the StructuredProperties constructor. use
StructuredProperties.getRoot() to get the root hashmap, at which
point you can read entries as you normally would.

The API will eventually provide a getEntry method which will allow
you to specify the path to an item using "root.subpart.subpart.item"
but that is currently not implemented.

Example:

    File f = new File(args[0]);
    StructuredProperties c = new StructuredProperties(f);
    System.out.println(c.getRoot().toString());
